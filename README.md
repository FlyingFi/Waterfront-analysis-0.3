This grasshopper definition is designed for urban planners and landscape architects when designing/renovating a city's waterfront. It is constructive at the initial stage of design, when a site is undecided, or when a rough site is chosen, and the site's zoning is to be decided. It shows the existing waterfront condition as well as the condition when new planned waterfront sites are implemented.

**What you need:**

- Install Grasshopper in Rhino 6 or 7 for either windows or mac.
- Install 'Caribou' (must) & 'Human' (maybe) to allow the definition to work correctly.
- Download OpenStreetMap data.

**Sample map:**

**The final map consisting of layers:**

1. A customized layer of Area of Interest - define your regions and values (those components are shown in black).
2. A base layer - coastline & major railways & waterways.
3. A zoning layer - Private; Commercial; Open public; Industrial.
4. A waterfront access point layer - access points that connect the sea with the inland area, e.g. piers, ports and terminals.
5. A legend that shows the different colours and the percentage made up of the zones.
